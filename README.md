.There are minimal bugs in the webpage.The media queries are not very effective when resizing .The images in the portfolio are also not sized effectively to fit into the webpage.The what we do icons are also not aligned.Report if there are other unknown bugs. 
## Technologies Used
I used html in writing the content of the landing page, resizing the images and making the headings bold.}I used css and bootstrap in styling the webpage and hiding the toggle sections.I used javascript and jquery to add the toggle effects in the what we do section and hover effect in the ordering section.I used html to make the forms at the contact section.
Javascript prototypes and constructors were used in the ordering section.
